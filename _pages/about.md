Welcome to my academic portfolio. With a Ph.D. in blockchain and applied cryptography obtained from Monash University in August 2023, I am deeply passionate about blockchain technology. During my doctoral journey, I had the privilege of being mentored by [Dr. Jiangshan Yu](https://www.jiangshanyu.com/) and [Prof. Joseph K. Liu](https://users.monash.edu.au/~kailiu/). My research is dedicated to advancing the security and scalability of blockchain systems, with a primary focus on pioneering innovative off-chain solutions. As a Postdoctoral Researcher, my current mission is to explore the practical applications of blockchain technology, bridging the gap between theoretical potential and real-world utility.


Research Focus
======
Blockchain System Security
1. Empirical study of Blockchain system based on maintainer's incentive strategies, analyzing how various incentives influence system robustness;
2. Developing robust security protocols to counteract vulnerabilities;
3. Ensuring the reliability of blockchain transactions and data.

Scalability Solutions
1. Designing off-chain transactions to reduce blockchain congestion;
2. Proposing innovation methods to enhance transaction processing capacity.

User Privacy
1. Employing advanced cryptographic tools to protect user's transaction;
2. Designing systems that balance scalability with confidentiality.
